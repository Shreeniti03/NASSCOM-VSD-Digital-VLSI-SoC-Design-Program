# Day 1 : Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
-How to talk to computers.

-SoC design and openLANE

-get familiar to open source EDA tools 
●VLSI technology is crucial for integrating numerous tiny transistors onto chips, making electronics faster, smaller, and more cost-effective.
●The Arduino board relies on a microcontroller unit (MCU) to perform essential tasks like reading sensors and controlling lights.
●Chip manufacturing facilities, or foundries, are vital in determining the performance of chips used in devices like Arduino boards.
●Key components of a chip include the core, pads, and die, which are essential for logic implementation and signal transmission.
●The Sky130_fd_sc_hd variant from SkyWater foundry provides necessary technology files for chip design, with tools like OPENLANE requiring specific commands for design processes.
